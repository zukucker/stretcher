# stretcher
Just a handy tool which informs you to stretch, after a given time.

To use it - change the Time to wait in the "main.rs".
Then do "cargo run".

#Install
If you wanna install it permanently do "cargo install --path ."
Now its executable by "stretcher".


Pls forgive me :D - its the first rust project and just for experimental things.
Thanks to notify-rust - very easy!
